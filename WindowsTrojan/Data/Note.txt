Hi There, 

You should have really checked this File, as it has now infected your PC, with a very special trojan
(Didn't your mom ever tell you not to open strange files!)

:D

Terminating this will cause the Immediate destruction of your PC, 
so don't even bother trying it
Find the Solution to this before it's too late to save your precious files :D
(And Your MBR gets corrupted)

With Love, 
CDAGaming :)
